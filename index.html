              <h2>What is a Black Hole?</h2>
              <p>Black holes are formed when massive stars collapse in on themselves at the end of their life cycle. The gravity of the
                dense ojbect produced from collapse of the star is so strong that not even light can escape its grasp. There is an area
                around a black hole called the event horizon where once reached, gravity becomes too strong to overcome and escape.  Because the laws
                of physics start to break down once you pass the event horizon into the black hole, espcially as you approach 'the singularity' (center of a black hole), there are many 
                theories as to what happens there. Black holes are challenging to detect because they are invisible to the naked eye as they don't emit light.
                However, their prescence can be detected by observing the effects black holes have on nearby objects. Below is a video from The 
                National Geographic YouTube channel describing black holes.

              <h2>What's the opposite of a black hole?</h2>
              <p>A white hole is the opposite of a black hole.  It is at this point theoretical, however it may help explain the origin
                 of our universe. Unlike a black hole's strong gravity, a white hole has a gravity so weak that no matter can enter 
                 the white hole, including light. There is no evidence currently that supports the existence of white holes or that they occur naturally. 
                 They are thought to be formed via a connection to a black hole through a hypothetical "wormhole" in the fabric of space and time.
                 Essentially the theory is that black holes pull everything in via one end, and white holes disperse everything via the other end 
                 (which very similar to the Big Bang Theory describing the origin of the universe). Watch this video from YouTube channel PBS Spacetime for a deeper dive on white holes.
